# PART 1: Directions on Using Webstorm.

Open, check out, or create a project﻿
A project in WebStorm is a folder with the source code you edit, the libraries and tools you use (for example, in the node_modules subfolder), and various app configuration files (for example, package.json or .eslintrc).

Once you have opened a folder in WebStorm, the .idea subfolder is added to it where WebStorm stores its internal configuration settings, for example, for the project code style or the version control system.

You can open, check out, and create projects from the WebStorm Welcome screen.


To create a new file in a project
In the Project tool window, select the folder where you want to create a new file and press Alt+Insert.

Alternatively, choose New from the context menu of the selection and then choose the file type


## Get familiar with the WebStorm user interface
The WebStorm window consists of the Editor where you read, create, and modify your code, menus and toolbars, a navigation bar, a status bar, and a number of WebStorm tool windows. These secondary windows are attached to the bottom and to the sides of your workspace and let you debug your code, run tests, interact with your version control system, and so on.

You can organize the layout of WebStorm as you like. For example, if you want to focus on writing your code, try the Distraction Free Mode. It removes all toolbars, tool windows, and editor tabs, so you have more free space. To switch to this mode, choose View | Appearance | Enter Distraction Free Mode from the main menu.

An alternative to the Distraction Free Mode may be hiding all tool windows by pressing Ctrl+Shift+F12. You can restore the layout to its default by pressing this shortcut once again.

When the tool windows are hidden, you can access any of them via a shortcut - the input focus moves to the tool window and you can use any keyboard command in its context. To get back to the editor, just press Escape. When a tool window is visible, pressing its shortcut just brings the focus to it.

# Part 2: Glossary
- **Branch**: A branch is essentially is a unique set of code changes with a unique name. Each repository can have one or more branches
- **Clone**: When you clone a repository, you copy the repository from GitHub.com to your local machine.
- **Commit**: A commit, or "revision", is an individual change to a file (or set of files).
- **Fetch**: The git fetch command downloads commits, files, and refs from a remote repository into your local repo.
- **GIT**: Git is the free and open source distributed version control system that's responsible for everything GitHub related that happens locally on your computer.
- **Github**: GitHub, Inc. is a provider of Internet hosting for software development and version control using Git. It offers the distributed version control and source code management functionality of Git, plus its own features.
- **Merge**: Merging is Git's way of putting a forked history back together again. The git merge command lets you take the independent lines of development created by git branch and integrate them into a single branch.
- **Merge Conflict**: Merge conflicts happen when you merge branches that have competing commits, and Git needs your help to decide which changes to incorporate in the final merge. Git can often resolve differences between branches and merge them automatically.
- **Push**: The git push command is used to upload local repository content to a remote repository. Pushing is how you transfer commits from your local repository to a remote repo. It's the counterpart to git fetch , but whereas fetching imports commits to local branches, pushing exports commits to remote branches.
- **Pull**: Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub. Once a pull request is opened, you can discuss and review the potential changes with collaborators and add follow-up commits before your changes are merged into the base branch.
- **Remote**: A remote in Git is a common repository that all team members use to exchange their changes. In most cases, such a remote repository is stored on a code hosting service like GitHub or on an internal server. In contrast to a local repository, a remote typically does not provide a file tree of the project's current state.
- **Repository**: A software repository, or “repo” for short, is a storage location for software packages. Often a table of contents is also stored, along with metadata. A software repository is typically managed by source control or repository managers.
