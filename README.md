# PART 1: Directions on Using Webstorm.

Open, check out, or create a projectï»¿
A project in WebStorm is a folder with the source code you edit, the libraries and tools you use (for example, in the node_modules subfolder), and various app configuration files (for example, package.json or .eslintrc).

Once you have opened a folder in WebStorm, the .idea subfolder is added to it where WebStorm stores its internal configuration settings, for example, for the project code style or the version control system.

You can open, check out, and create projects from the WebStorm Welcome screen.


To create a new file in a project
In the Project tool window, select the folder where you want to create a new file and press Alt+Insert.

Alternatively, choose New from the context menu of the selection and then choose the file type


## Get familiar with the WebStorm user interface
The WebStorm window consists of the Editor where you read, create, and modify your code, menus and toolbars, a navigation bar, a status bar, and a number of WebStorm tool windows. These secondary windows are attached to the bottom and to the sides of your workspace and let you debug your code, run tests, interact with your version control system, and so on.

You can organize the layout of WebStorm as you like. For example, if you want to focus on writing your code, try the Distraction Free Mode. It removes all toolbars, tool windows, and editor tabs, so you have more free space. To switch to this mode, choose View | Appearance | Enter Distraction Free Mode from the main menu.

An alternative to the Distraction Free Mode may be hiding all tool windows by pressing Ctrl+Shift+F12. You can restore the layout to its default by pressing this shortcut once again.

When the tool windows are hidden, you can access any of them via a shortcut - the input focus moves to the tool window and you can use any keyboard command in its context. To get back to the editor, just press Escape. When a tool window is visible, pressing its shortcut just brings the focus to it.
