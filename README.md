# PART 1: Directions on Using Webstorm.

Open, check out, or create a projectï»¿
A project in WebStorm is a folder with the source code you edit, the libraries and tools you use (for example, in the node_modules subfolder), and various app configuration files (for example, package.json or .eslintrc).

Once you have opened a folder in WebStorm, the .idea subfolder is added to it where WebStorm stores its internal configuration settings, for example, for the project code style or the version control system.

You can open, check out, and create projects from the WebStorm Welcome screen.
